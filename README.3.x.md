> [!TIP]
> If you want to change the download folder later, you can edit the `emd.ini` file in any text editor. Just update the `emupath` setting with the new location.

## *Optional: If you you would like to run the PowerShell script instead of the exe*

1. **Run the batch file**
   - In a cmd window, type the following command and press **Enter**:
     ```bash
     EAD-3.bat
     ```
     **The emu-updater.bat need to be in the same directory as the script.**
     
   - On the first run, the script will ask you where you’d like to download the emulators. Choose a folder on your computer where you want to keep them.

4. **Select Emulators**
   - After that, the script will show you a list of emulators. You can pick the ones you want or download all of them at once.
