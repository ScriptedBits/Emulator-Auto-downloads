Welcome to my little project to help Retro gamers get the latest versions of the top emulators.

Supported emulators:

BigEmu
MAME
PPSSPP
PCSX2
RPCS3
Dolphin
XEMU
Xenia
Ryujinx
Duckstation
Vita3k


As of release .1 most downloads are working.  Some do give PS errors. Those are being worked on for future releases.
If you don't see an emulator that you would like to see added please leave a comment.
