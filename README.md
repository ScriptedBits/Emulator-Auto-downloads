    Note: You can modify the emd.ini file to update the emupath to your preferred download location. See emd.ini for more details.

Future Features:

    The ability to select emulator versions for different operating systems: Windows, Mac, or Linux.
    Support for additional emulators such as RetroArch (I know it's not really an emulator! ðŸ˜„), Supermodel, Cxbx, ShadPS4, fpPS4, Project64, and more!
    - Continued improvements to the user interface.
    - Digital signature for the script for enhanced security.
