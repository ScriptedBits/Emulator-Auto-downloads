# Welcome to the Emulator Auto-Download Project! #

Emulator Auto-Downloads is a passion project designed to save time by automating the download of the latest versions of popular gaming emulators. Powered by PowerShell, this script eliminates the hassle of manually finding and updating emulators, letting users focus on their favorite retro and modern games. Whether you're setting up a new system or maintaining an existing one, this tool makes managing a wide range of emulatorsâ€”from retro classics to modern consolesâ€”effortless.

# Announcement ðŸš€ #

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the release of **Emulator Auto-Download v3.0!** This major update adds support for downloading Windows, Mac, and Linux versions of over 30 emulators, along with a completely rewritten menu system and extensive backend improvements.

For easy execution on Windows 10/11 systems, a compiled EXE using PS2EXE is now included.

## Requirements:

- A Windows 10 or 11 PC
- PowerShell version 5 or higher (PowerShell is already installed on most Windows PCs)

## Easy Installation Steps:

1. **Download the Latest Version**
   - Visit the projectâ€™s release page and download the latest version.

2. **Run the EAD-3.exe file**

   - On the first run, you will be asked you where youâ€™d like to download the emulators. Choose a folder on your computer where you want to keep them.

3. **Select which OS versions of the Emulators to download**

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change the download folder later, you can edit the `emd.ini` file in any text editor. Just update the `emupath` setting with the new location.

## *Optional: If you you would like to run the PowerShell script instead of the exe*

1. **Run the batch file**
   - In a cmd window, type the following command and press **Enter**:
     ```bash
     EAD-3.bat
     ```
     **The emu-updater.bat need to be in the same directory as the script.**
     
   - On the first run, the script will ask you where youâ€™d like to download the emulators. Choose a folder on your computer where you want to keep them.

4. **Select Emulators**
   - After that, the script will show you a list of emulators. You can pick the ones you want or download all of them at once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change the download folder later, you can edit the `emd.ini` file in any text editor. Just update the `emupath` setting with the new location.

 
 




## Future Features (Coming Soon):

- Support for more emulators, including **Cxbx**, **fpPS4** and more!
- Improvements to the user interface.
- Digital signatures for the script to enhance security.
